* mirage2iso install guide *


1. PREREQUISITES

 * C99-capable C toolkit,
 * libmirage < 1.2,
 * pkg-config.


2. CONFIGURATION

If you don't have pkg-config or libmirage < 1.2 installed, expect
standard compilation failure with some less or more readable output.

Use 'configure' script to determine system capabilities, configure
the build and create the Makefile.

Note: this is not autotools configure script and it doesn't accept
arguments like standard 'configure' scripts. If you want e.g. to change
destination PREFIX, provide correct parameter to 'make install'
as explained below.


3. COMPILATION

It's all just plain make. It uses following variables either provided
in command-line or gathered from environment:
	CC, CFLAGS, LDFLAGS

If your environment is set right, you may compile it by calling:
	$ make


4. INSTALLATION

The Makefile provides 'install' target with following variables
for fine-tuning installation location:
	DESTDIR, PREFIX, BINDIR

mirage2iso doesn't internally depend on any of these paths (it is 100%
location-independent) you may set them to anything. But the preferred
solution is to use PREFIX as system-wide install prefix (like '/usr')
and DESTDIR for fake root installs.

To install mirage2iso into /usr/local tree just call:
	# make install
But when creating packages you should probably instead use:
	# make PREFIX=/usr DESTDIR="${D}" install
where "${D}" is the fake root dir.

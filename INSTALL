* mirage2iso install guide *


1. PREREQUISITES

 * C99-capable C toolkit,
 * libmirage < 1.2,
 * pkg-config.


2. CONFIGURATION

If you don't have pkg-config or libmirage < 1.2 installed, expect
standard compilation failure with some less or more readable output.

Use 'configure' script to determine system capabilities, configure
the build and create the Makefile:
	$ ./configure

To get list of options that configure accepts, use:
	$ ./configure --help


3. COMPILATION

It's all just plain make. It uses following variables either provided
in command-line or gathered from environment:
	CC, CFLAGS, LDFLAGS

If your environment is set right, you can compile m2i by calling:
	$ make


4. INSTALLATION

The Makefile provides an 'install' target which installs the binary
in the appropriate directory. By default, that is '/usr/local'; you may
fine-tune the install prefix using '--prefix' option to configure
script. You can also install m2i into fake root using DESTDIR macro.

To simply install:
	# make install

If you're going to create a package you would probably use:
	# make DESTDIR="${D}" install
instead, where "${D}" is the fake root dir.

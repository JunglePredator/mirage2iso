* mirage2iso install guide *


1. PREREQUISITES

 * C99-capable C toolkit,
 * libmirage < 1.2,
 * pkg-config.


2. CONFIGURATION

mirage2iso doesn't come with any configure script. Basically,
Makefile directly gathers information about libmirage from pkg-config.

If you don't have pkg-config or libmirage < 1.2 installed, expect
standard compilation failure with some less or more readable output.

By default, mirage2iso uses GNU & POSIX C extensions. You can disable
them by either defining NO_GNU or NO_POSIX (second implies first). You
can disable only specific features too using following defines:
	-DNO_GETOPT_LONG (GNU ext)
		disable use of getopt_long()
	-DNO_MMAPIO (POSIX ext)
		disable use of ftruncate() and mmap() to get mmaped I/O


3. COMPILATION

It's all just plain make. It uses following variables either provided
in command-line or gathered from environment:
	CC, CFLAGS, CPPFLAGS, LDFLAGS

If your environment is set right, you may compile it by calling:
	$ make

As CPPFLAGS mostly isn't rather defined globally, you should use it
to define compile options, like:
	$ make CPPFLAGS='-DNO_POSIX'
to compile on non-POSIX systems.


4. INSTALLATION

The Makefile provides 'install' target with following variables
for fine-tuning installation location:
	DESTDIR, PREFIX, BINDIR

mirage2iso doesn't internally depend on any of these paths (it is 100%
location-independent) you may set them to anything. But the preferred
solution is to use PREFIX as system-wide install prefix (like '/usr')
and DESTDIR for fake root installs.

To install mirage2iso into /usr/local tree just call:
	# make install
But when creating packages you should probably instead use:
	# make PREFIX=/usr DESTDIR="${D}" install
where "${D}" is the fake root dir.
